export const story =
  "Excellence Consultancy Services was born out of a shared vision to make a meaningful impact in the realm of quality and compliance  management. Despite the presence of numerous consultancies, we recognized a unique opportunity to bring a more tailored, client-centric approach to the industry. Founded in 2024 by three seasoned professionals with decades of combined experience, our firm is built on the principles of integrity, expertise, and innovation. We realized that many consultancies focus on ticking boxes, but we wanted to go beyond that – to empower our clients with knowledge, to      be their partners in growth, and to ensure they not only meet but exceed the standards of their respective industries.";
